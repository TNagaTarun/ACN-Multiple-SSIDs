# This program emulates point to point networks that connect two hosts `h1`
# and `h2` via a router `r1`. Five ping packets are sent from `h1` to `h2`, and
# the success/failure of these packets is reported. It also prints the routes
# from the routing table of a router `r1`.

# The routes are dumped into three files. The routes of the `eth1a` interface of
# the node `r1` are dumped to `route_info_of_interface_r1-h2-0.json`. Similarly
# the routes of `eth1b` interface onto `route_info_of_interface_r1-h2-0.json`.
# Finally it prints all the routes from the node `r1` into another file.
