# Examples to demonstrate the usage of BIRD Internet Routing Daemon (BIRD) Suite in NeST

This directory contains the examples to demonstrate how BIRD Internet Routing Daemon
(BIRD) suite can be used for emulating dynamic routing in `NeST`.

`IMPORTANT`: BIRD module is not installed by default in Linux. Hence, before
running this program, install the BIRD module as explained below (ignore if
BIRD is already installed).

BIRD can be obtained from your Linux distribution packages. For Ubuntu, run:

```shell
sudo apt install bird
```

## 1. bird-ospf-point-to-point-2.py
This program emulates point to point networks that connect two hosts `h1`
and `h2` via a router `r1`. Five ping packets are sent from `h1` to `h2`, and
the success/failure of these packets is reported. It is similar to
`ah-point-to-point-2.py` available in `examples/address-helpers`, the only
difference is that we use Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), a dynamic routing
protocol, instead of manually configuring the routes. This program uses OSPF
from BIRD Internet Routing Daemon (BIRD) suite for dynamic routing. A new package called
`RoutingHelper` is imported in this program. The routing logs are written to
files in a dedicated `logs` directory.

`Note`: The above examples can be modified to work with IPv6 addressing by
changing the IPv4 subnets to IPv6 subnets. Replace IPv4 subnets
`192.168.1.0/24`, `192.168.2.0/24` and `192.168.13.0/24` by IPv6 subnets
`2001:1::/122`, `2001:2::/122` and `2001:3::/122`, respectively.
